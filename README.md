# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

How to Install :
1. Go to main branch
2. Download nvm + npm + node (or whatever that is needed)
3. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/Kyzure/cs4249-eatigo-website-redesign.git`
5. Open command prompt and go to directory you cloen repository
4. Create new branch (Unless u wanna push to main lmao) `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
5. Run the command: `npm install` (idk if this works)

How to Edit (Once you install all the shit):
1. Run the command: `npm start` (to start locally at localhost 3000)
2. "Edit the code and see changes"
3. Push to your branch and do merge request (or push to main if u got balls): `git push your-branch-name`
4. Change branch to main: `git checkout main`
5. Run the command: `npm run deploy`(Pushes the changes to deployment, or the github pages)
6. Change back to your branch: `git checkout your-branch-name`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
